### 1. ATS Optimization and Automated Form Filling  

**Overview:**  
The recruitment process often requires candidates to manually fill out multiple job application forms, which is both time-consuming and prone to errors. Additionally, many resumes fail to align with job descriptions, reducing their chances of passing ATS (Applicant Tracking System) filters.  

## Our Solution  
Our solution aims to address two key challenges:  

- **Automating form filling** – The user needs to enter their details once, after which they can simply drop multiple Google Form links, and the system will auto-fill the required fields.  
- **Enhancing resume effectiveness** – The system will analyze the resume and suggest improvements to optimize ATS compatibility, ensuring better alignment with job descriptions.  

**Plan:**  
- Identify patterns in company forms and automate the form-filling process.  
- Modify resumes to increase ATS scores if they are below 80%.  
- Use NLP for resume parsing and web automation for form submission.

### 2. Chatbot for Diabetic Patients  

**Overview:**  
Aged diabetic patients often struggle with medication reminders and managing emergency situations.  

**Plan:**  
- Develop a chatbot that provides prescription reminders and emergency health tips.  
- Offer relaxation techniques and instant precautionary measures before consulting a doctor.  
- Ensure responses are medically accurate and reliable.

### 3. AI-Based Product Analysis for E-Commerce  

**Overview:**  
Online sellers often need to manually describe products, which is time-consuming.  

**Plan:**  
- Use AI models to analyze product images and auto-generate descriptions.  
- Provide insights on product features, pricing recommendations, and market value.  
- Implement computer vision and NLP to enhance automation.
